                <p>My brain (and yours, too, dear reader) is constantly seeking to label, to categorize, to find precedents and analogues--in other words, _to simplify while not letting essence slip away_. It carries on this activity relentlessly, not only in response to freshly arriving sensory input but also in response to its own internal dance, and there really is not much of a difference between the two cases, for once sensory input has gotten beyond the retina or the tympani or the skin, it enters the realm of the _internal_, and from that point on, perception is solely an internal affair.</p>

            <content exact="true">
                <p>It's a subtle idea whose crux is that what you call "I" is an _outcome_, not a starting point. You've coalesced in an unplanned fashion, coming only slowly into existence, not in a flash. At the beginning, when the brain that would later house your soul was taking form, there was no you. But that brain slowly grew, and its experiences slowly accumulated. Somewhere along the way, as more and more things happened to it, were registered by it, and became internalized in it, it started imitating the cultural and linguistic conventions in which it was immersed, and thus it tentatively said "I" about itself (even though the referent of that word was still blurry). That's roughly when it noticed it was somewhere--and not surprisingly, it was where a certain brain was! At that point, though, it didn't know anything about its brain. What it knew instead was its brain's _container_, which was a certain body. But even though it didn't know anything about its brain, that nascent "I" faithfully followed its brain around just as a shadow always tags along after a moving object.</p>

            <title>the illusion of "I"</title>
            <content exact="true">
                <p>The problem is that in a sense, an "I" is something created out of nothing. And since making something out of nothing is never possible, the alleged something turns out to be an illusion, in the end, but a very powerful one, like the?? marble among the envelopes....</p>
                <p>One thing that gives many people a sneaking suspicion is that something about this "I" notion might be mythical was precisely what you've been troubled about all through our discussion--namely, there seems to be something incompatible between the hard laws of physics and the existence of vague, shadowy things called "I"'s....</p>
                <p>A second hint that something needs revision has to do with what we perceive as causing what. In our everyday life, we take it for granted that an "I" can cause things, can push things around. If I decide to drive to the grocery store, my one-ton automobile winds up taking me there and bringing me back. Now that seems pretty peculiar in the world of physics, where everything comes about solely as a result of how particles interact. How does the particle story leave room for a shadowy, ethereal "I" to cause a heavy car to move somewhere? This, too, casts a bit of doubt on the reality of the notion of "I".</p>

            <title>consciousness as the recursive dance of symbols</title>
            <content exact="true">
                <p>The basic idea is that the dance of symbols in a brain is itself perceived by symbols, and that step extends the dance, and so round and round it goes. That, in a nutshell, is what consciousness is. But if you recall, symbols are simply large phenomena made out of nonsymbolic neural activity, so you can shift viewpoint and get rid of the language of symbols entirely, in which case the "I" disintegrates. It just poofs out of existence, so there's no room left for downward causality.</p>

            <title>the necessity of having an "I"</title>
            <content exact="true">
                <p>Sometimes the strict scientific viewpoint _is_ hopelessly useless, even if it's correct. That's a dilemma. As I said, the human condition is, by its very nature, one of believing in a myth. And we're permanently trapped in that condition, which makes life rather interesting....</p>
                <p>Just as we need our eyes in order to _see_, we need our "I"'s in order to _be_! We humans are beings whose fate it is to be able to perceive abstractions, and to be driven to do so. We are beings that spend their lives sorting the world into an ever-growing hierarchy of patterns, all represented by symbols in our brains. We constantly come up with new symbols by putting together previous symbols in new kinds of structures, nearly _ad infinitum_. Moreover, being macroscopic, we can't see the way down to the level where physical causality happens, so in compensation, we find all sorts of marvelously efficient shorthand ways of describing what goes on, because the world, though it's pretty crazy and chaotic, is nonetheless filled with regularities that can be counted on most of the time.</p>

            <title>perception and the sense of being alive</title>
            <content exact="true">
                <p>The sense of being alive and being a unique link in the infinite chain certainly _is_ profound. It's just that it doesn't transcend physical law. To the contrary, it is a profound exploitation of physical law--hardly mundane! On the other hand, the all-too-common desire to mystify the pronoun "I", as if it concealed a deeper mystery than other words do, truly muddies up the picture. The sole root of all these strange phenomena is _perception_, bringing symbols and meanings into physical systems. To perceive is to make a fantastic jump from William James' "blooming, blazing confusion" to an abstract, symbolic level. And then, when perception twists back and focuses on itself, as it inevitably will, you get rich, magical-seeming consequences. Magical-_seeming_, mind you, but not _truly_ magical. You get the reality of everything else in the world. This "I", this unreal but utterly stubborn marble in the mind, this "Epi" phenomenon, simply takes over, anointing itself as Reality Number One, and from there on out it won't go away, no matter what words are spoken.</p>

            <content exact="true">
                <p>My claim that "I" is a hallucination perceived by a hallucination is somewhat like the heliocentric viewpoint--it can yield new insights but it's very counterintuitive, and it's hardly conductive to easy communication with other human beings, who all believe in their "I"'s with indomitable fervor. We explain our own behavior, and that of others, through that positing of our own "I" and its analogues in other people. This naive viewpoint allows us to talk about the world of people in terms that make perfect sense to people....</p>
                <p>Ceasing to believe altogether in the "I" is in fact impossible, because it is indispensable for survival. Like it or not, we humans are stuck for good with this myth.</p>

            <title>a boy with weakness in the left premotor cortex</title>
            <content exact="true">
                <p>One boy with this problem [weakness in the left premotor cortex] was always frustrated, because his thoughts came faster than he could turn them into speech.... He was a very social person yet could not express himself and so remained silent much of the time. When he was asked a question in class, he often knew the answer but took such a painfully long time to get it out but he appeared much less intelligent than he was, and he began to doubt himself.</p>
                <p>When we write a thought, our brain converts the words--which are symbols--into movements of the fingers and hands. The same boy had very jerky writing because his processing capacity for converting symbols into movements was easily overloaded, so he had to write with many separate, small movements instead of long, flowing ones. Even though he had been taught cursive writing, he preferred to print. (As adults, people with this problem can often be identified because they prefer to print or type. When we print, we make each letter separately, with just a few pen movements, which is less demanding on the brain. In cursive we write several letters at a time, and the brain must process more complex movements.) Writing was especially painful for the boy, since he often knew the right answers on tests but wrote so slowly that he couldn't get them all down. Or he would think of one word, letter, or number but write another. These children are often accused of being careless, but actually their overloaded brains fire the wrong motor movements.</p>
                <p>Students with this disability also have reading problems. Normally when we read, the brain reads part of the sentence, then directs the eyes to move the right distance across the page to take in the next part of the sentence, requiring an ongoing sequence of precise eye movements.</p>
                <p>The boy's reading was very slow because he skipped words, lost his place, and then lost his concentration. Reading was overwhelming and exhausting. On exams he would often misread the question, and when he tried to proofread his answers, he'd skip whole sections.</p>
                <p>At the Arrowsmith School this boy's brain exercises involved tracing complex lines to stimulate his neurons in the weakened premotor area. Barbara [Arrowsmith Young] has found that tracing exercises improve children in all three areas--speaking, writing, and reading. By the time the boy graduated, he read above grade level and could read for pleasure for the first time. He spoke more spontaneously in longer, fuller sentences, and his writing improved.</p>

                <p>We all have some weak brain functions, and such neuroplasticity-based techniques have great potential to help almost everyone....</p>
                <p>The Arrowsmith approach, and the use of brain exercises generally, has major implications for education. Clearly many children would benefit from a brain-area-based assessment to identify their weakened functions and a program to strengthen--a far more productive approach than tutoring that simply repeats a lesson and leads to endless frustration. When "weak links in the chain" are strengthened, people gain access to skills whose development was formerly blocked, and they feel enormously liberated.</p>

            <title>the value of rote memorization and handwriting practice</title>
            <content exact="true">
                <p>The irony of this new discovery [the benefits of brain exercises] is that for hundreds of years educators did seem to sense that children's brains had to be built up through exercises of increasing difficulty that strengthened brain functions. Up through the 19th and early 20th centuries a classical education often included rote memorzation of long poems in foreign languages, which strengthened the auditory memory (hence thinking in language) and an almost fanatical attention to handwriting, which probably helped strengthen motor capacities and thus not only helped handwriting but added speed and fluency to reading and speaking. Often a great deal of attention was paid to exact elocution and to perfecting the pronunciation of words. Then in the 1960s educators dropped such traditional exercises from the curriculum, because they were too rigid, boring, and "not relevant." But the loss of these drills has been costly; they may have been the only opportunity that many students had to systematically exercise the brain function that gives us fluency and grace with symbols. For the rest of us, their disappearance may have contributed to the general decline of eloquence, which requires memory and a level of auditory brainpower unfamiliar to us now. In the Lincoln-Douglas debates in 1858 the debaters would comfortably speak for an hour or more without notes, in extended memorized paragraphs; today many of the most learned among us, raised in our most elite schools since the 1960s, prefer the omnipresent PowerPoint presentation--the ultimate compensation for a weak premotor cortex.</p>

            <title>benefits of brain exercises; brain pruning in adolescence</title>
            <content exact="true">
                <p>Younger children often progress more quickly through brain exercises than do adolescents, perhaps because in an immature brain the number of connections among neurons, or synapses, is 50 percent greater than in the adult brain.When we reach adolescence, a massive "pruning back" operation begins in the brain, and synaptic connections and neurons that have not been used extensively suddenly die off--a classic case of "use it or lose it." It is probably best to strengthen weakened areas while all this extra cortical real estate is available. Still, brain-based assessments can be helpful all through school and even in college and university, when many students who did well in high school fail because their weak brain functions are overloaded by the increased demand. Even apart from these crises, every adult could benefit from a brain-based cognitive assessment, a cognitive fitness test, to help them better understand their own brain.</p>

            <content exact="true">
                <p>Mental training or life in rich environments increases brain weight by 5 percent in the cerebral cortex of animals and up to 9 percent in areas that the training directly stimulates. Trained or stimulated neurons develop 25 percent more branches and increase their size, the number of connections per neuron, and their blood supply. These changes can occur late in life, though they do not develop as rapidly in older animals as in younger ones. Similar effects of training and enrichment on brain anatomy have been seen in all types of animals tested to date.</p>

            <content exact="true">
                <p>Clearly when we learn, we increase what we know. But [Michael] Merzenich's claim is that we can also change the very structure of the brain itself and increase its capacity to learn. Unlike the computer, the brain is constantly adapting itself.</p>
                <p>"The cerebral cortex," he says of the thin outer layer of the brain, "is actually selectively refining its processing capabilities to fit each task at hand." It doesn't simply learn; it is always "learning how to learn." The brain Merzenich describes is not an inanimate vessel that we fill; rather it is more like a living creature with an appetite, one that can grow and change itself with proper nourishment and exercise. Before Merzenich's work, the brain was seen as a complex machine, having unalterable limits on memory, processing speed, and intelligence. Merzenich has shown that each of these assumptions is wrong.</p>

He also discovered that when he touched certain parts of the brain, he triggered long-lost childhood memories or dreamlike scenes--which implied that higher mental activities are also mapped in the brain.</p>

                <p>Like my fatuous notion of optional "_Racecar Power_", which in reality is nothing but the upper end of a continuous spectrum of horsepower levels that engines automatically possess as a result of their design, consciousness is nothing but the upper end of the spectrum of self-perception levels that brains automatically possess as a result of their design. Fancy 100-huneker-and-higher racecar brains like yours and mine have a lot of self-perception and hence a lot of consciousness, while very primitive wind-up rubber-band brains like those of mosquitoes have essentially none of it, and lastly, middle-level brains, with just a handful of hunekers (like that of a two-year-old, or a pet cat or dog) come with a modicum of it.</p>
                <p>Consciousness is not an add-on option when one has a 100-huneker brain; it is an inevitable emergent consequence of the fact that the system has a sufficiently sophisticated repertoire of categories. Like Godel's strange loop, which arises _automatically_ in any sufficiently powerful formal system of number theory, the strange loop of selfhood will automatically arise in any sufficiently sophisticated repertoire of categories, and once you got self, you got consciousness. _Elan mental_ is not needed.</p>

            <content exact="true">
                <p>Compassion, magnanimity, reverence for life--all these are qualities epitomzed by Albert Schweitzer, who in addition had a remarkable quality of being a reverential Bach organist--but to my mind this is no accident. Some might say that Schweitzer and people of his rare caliber are _selfless_. I understand this idea and I think there's some truth to it, but on the other hand, oddly enough, I have been arguing, as does etymology, that the more magnanimous one is, the _greater_ one's self or soul is, not the smaller! So I would say that those who strike us as self-less are in fact very soul-full--that is, that house many other souls inside their own skulls/brains/minds/souls--and I don't think this sharing of mind-space diminishes their central core but enlarges and enriches it. As Walt Whitman put it in his poem "Song of Myself", "I am large, I contain multitudes." All this richness is a consequence of the fact that some point in the dim past, the generic human brain surpassed a critical threshold of flexibility and became quasi-universal, able to internailze the abstract essences of other human brains. It is something to marvel at.</p>

            <title>friendship as a sign of consciousness</title>
            <content exact="true">
                <p>One day, as I was trying to figure out where I personally draw the line for applying the word "conscious" (even though of course there's no sharp cutoff), it occurred to me that the most crucial factor was whether or not the entity in question could be said to have some notion, perhaps only very primitive, of "friend", a friend being someone you care about and who cares about you....</p>
                <p>It's clear that dogs feel that certain humans and dogs are their friends, and possibly also a few other animals. I won't try to enumerate which types of animals seem capable of acquiring the "friend" notion because it's blurry and because you can run down a mental list just as easily as I can. But the more I think about this, the righter it feels to me. And so I find myself led to the unexpected conclusion that what seems to be the epitome of selfhood--a sense of "I"--is in reality brought into being if and only if along with that self there is a sense of _other_ selves with whom one has bonds of affection. In short, only when generosity is born is an ego born.</p>

It is our inability to see, feel, or sense in any way the constant, frenetic churning and roiling of micro-stuff, all the unfelt bubbling and boiling that underlies our thinking. This, our innate blindness to the world of the tiny, forces us to hallucinate a profound schism between the goal-lacking material world of balls and sticks and sounds and lights, on the one hand, and a goal-pervaded abstract world of hopes and beliefs and joys and fears, on the other, in which radically different sorts of causality seem to reign.</p>

            <title>definition of "strange loop"</title>
            <content exact="true">
                <p>What I mean by "strange loop" is--here goes a first stab, anyway--not a physical circuit but an abstract loop in which, in a series of stages that constitute the cycling-around, there is a shift from one level of abstraction (or structure) to another, which feels like an upward movement in a hierarchy, and yet somehow the successive "upward" shifts turn out to give rise to a closed cycle. That is, despite one's sense of departing ever further from one's origin, one winds up, to one's shock, exactly where one had started out. In short, a strange loop as a paradoxical level-crossing feedback loop.</p>
                <p>One of the most canonical (and, I am sorry to say, now hackneyed) examples is M. C. Escher's lithograph _Drawing Hands_ ([shown] above), in which (depending on where one starts) one sees a right hand drawing a picture of a left hand (nothing paradoxical yet), and yet the left hand turns out to be drawing the right hand (all at once, it's a deep paradox).</p>
                <p>Here, the abstract shift in levels would be the upward leap from _drawn_ to _drawer_ (or equally, from _image_ to _artist_), the latter level being intuitively "above" the former, in more senses than one.</p>
            </content>
            <notes1>
                <p>The author says that _Drawing Hands_ isn't really a strange loop because one must buy into the fantasy that one is actually viewing two hands drawing each other, not merely looking at a drawing that depicts such a thing. He maintains that Godel's incompleteness theorem is truly a strange loop.</p>

            <title>critical period for visual processing in kittens</title>
            <content exact="true">
                <p>David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel were micromapping the visual cortex to learn how vision is processed. They'd inserted microelectrodes into the visual cortex of kittens and discovered that different parts of the cortex processed the lines, orientations, and movements of visually perceived objects. They also discovered that there was a "critical period," from the third to the eighth week of life, when the newborn kitten's brain _had to_ receive visual stimulation in order to develop normally. In the crucial experiment Hubel and Wiesel sewed shut one eyelid of a kitten during its critical period, so the eye got no visual stimulation. When they opened this shut eye, they found that the visual areas in the brain map that normally processed input from the shut eye, they found that the visual areas in the brain map that normally processed input from the shut eye had failed to develop, leaving the kitten blind in that hot for life. Clearly the brains of kittens during the critical period were plastic, their structure literally shaped by experience.</p>

            <content exact="true">
                <p>When Hubel and Wiesel examined the brain map for that blind eye, they made one more unexpected discovery about plasticity. The part of the kitten's brain that had been deprived of input from the shut eye did not remain idle. It had begun to process visual input from the open eye, as though the brain didn't want to waste any "cortical real estate" and had found a way to rewire itself--another indication that the brain is plastic in the critical period. For this work Hubel and Wiesel received the Nobel Prize</p>

            <content exact="true">
                <p>The competitive nature of plasticity affects us all. There is an endless war of nerves going on inside each of our brains. If we stop exercising our mental skills, we do not just forget them: the brain map space for those skills is turned over to the skills we practice instead. If you ever ask yourself, "How often must I practice French, or guitar, or math to keep on top of it?" You are asking a question about competitive plasticity. You are asking how frequently you must practice one activity to make sure its brain map space is not lost to another.</p>

            <content>
                <p>Imagine a harsh land that produces sustenance reluctantly. Imagine a very small village with just enough people to ensure mutual survival: two farmers, a doctor, a builder, several laborers. Births generally balanced deaths, and the same roles were always filled by the younger generation. If this continued for many generations and this village lived in isolation, it's possible that successive generations could see itself as a single organism, with the common good as each person's first thought and selfishness unthinkable. After all, if even one among them perished, everyone's survival was called into question.</p>
                <p>Now imagine that the village were to begin to grow. There are four farmers, two doctors, two builders, and a few more laborers than strictly necessary. Life becomes less harsh, less precarious. This slight surplus in no way alters the villagers' sense of interdependence because their selflessness is still crucial to their survival.</p>
                <p>As the village grows in size, individuals begin to specialize, life becomes less precarious, barter gives way to a formalized system of money.</p>
                <p>How might this village change as it continues to grow? As the villagers, their numbers expanded a thousandfold, become a people, might they not still maintain an undiluted awareness of their interdependence? Might not the concept of an "I" still be unthinkable, that they might live in the same kind of specialized harmony as do the organs and tissues of a single human form?</p>

            <title>I can be at peace with my past</title>
            <content>
                <p>I was having breakfast with Becky this morning at our usual hangout (Burger King, believe it or not) and we were having a good time together. We had both finished breakfast and were sitting together companionably, each of us reading and sipping cola. Occasionally, she would read out loud something she found interesting, and I returned the favor a few times.</p>
                <p>We sometimes talk about this: that the quiet happiness we have with each other is something neither of us expected to get out of this life. I found myself thinking this again and, realizing the magnitude of my wealth in this respect, something new blossomed in my heart. I slowly grew to comprehend that the gift of our companionship, of our partnership, is so bounteous that I can let go of all the losses that I have felt towards the years of my life that were consumed by depression. With this wealth, which in fact was the continuing endpoint of all my aspirations for a meaningful relationship, how could I possibly cling to these past losses that have formerly cost me such heartache? How ungrateful and churlish it would be to nurse those small losses in the face of having attained something so much more important.</p>
                <p>So I told Becky this, and she smiled and I smiled back, feeling so content and blessed. I think something _has_ shifted inside me, and I think those thoughts of the past will never trouble me again as much as they did before--and that is not an inconsiderable blessing of its own.</p>

            <title>competitive plasticity and bad habits</title>
            <content exact="true">
                <p>Competitive plasticity also explains why our bad habits are so difficult to break or "unlearn." Most of us think of the brain as a container and learning as putting something in it. When we try to break a bad habit, we think the solution is to put something new into the container. But when we learn a bad habit, it takes over a brain map, and each time we repeat it, it claims more control of that map and prevents the use of that space for "good" habits. That is why "unlearning" is often a lot harder than learning, and why early childhood education is so important--it's best to get it right early, before the "bad habit" gets a competitive advantage.</p>

                <p>Merzenich also noticed that animals of a particular species may have similar [brain] maps, but they are _never_ identical. Micromapping allowed him to see differences that Penfield, with larger electrodes, could not. He also found that the maps of normal body parts change every few weeks. Every time he mapped a normal monkey's face, it was unequivocally different. Plasticity doesn't require the provocation of cut nerves or amputations. Plasticity is a normal phenomenon, and brain maps are constantly changing.</p>

            <content exact="true">
                <p>It seems reasonable to assume that if totally new [brain] maps were forming, then new connections must have been forming among neurons. To help understand this process, Merzenich invoked the ideas of Donald O. Hebb, a Canadian behavioral psychologist who had worked with Penfield. In 1949 Hebb proposed that learning linked neurons in new ways. He proposed that when two neurons fire at the same time repeatedly (or when one fires, causing another to fire), chemical changes occur in both, so that the two tend to connect more strongly. Hebb's concept--actually proposed by Freud 60 years before--was neatly summarzed by neuroscientist Carlos Schatz--_Neurons that fire together wire together_.</p>

                <p>Other scientists tested Merzenich's findings [from experiment with monkeys' fingers] on human beings. Some people are born with their fingers fused, a condition called syndactyly or "webbed-finger syndrome." When to such people were mapped, the brain scan found that they each had one large map for their fused fingers instead of two separate ones.</p>
                <p>After surgeons separated the webbed fingers, the subjects' brains were remapped, and two distinct maps emerged for the two separated digits. Because the fingers could move independently, the neurons no longer fired simultaneously, illustrating another principal of plasticity: if you separate the signals to neurons in time, you create separate brain maps. In neuroscience this finding is now summarzed as: _Neurons that fire apart wire apart_--or _Neurons out of sync fail to link_.</p>

                <p>The experiment [which involved teaching a monkey to become more discriminating in its level of touch] also showed that as brain maps get bigger, the individual neurons get more efficient in two stages. At first, as the monkey trained, the map for the fingertip grew to take up more space. But after a while individual neurons within the map became more efficient, and eventually fewer neurons were required to perform the task....</p>
                <p>[This is analogous to a child who is beginning to play the piano, at first using far too many muscles to get the job done. With practice, the child] develops "grace" and relaxes when he plays. This is because the child goes from using a massive number of neurons to an appropriate few, well matched to the task. This more efficient use of neurons occurs whenever we become proficient at a skill, and it explains why we don't quickly run out of map space as we practice or add skills to our repertoire.</p>

                <p>[Michael] Merzenich and [Bill] Jenkins also showed that individual neurons got more selective with training. Each neuron in the brain map for the sense of touch has a "receptive field," a segment on the skin's surface that "reports" to it. As the monkeys were trained to feel the disk, the receptive fields of individual neurons got smaller, firing only when small parts of the fingertip touched the disk. Thus, despite the fact that the size of the brain map increased, each neuron in the map became responsible for a smaller part of the skin surface, allowing the animal to have finer touch discrimination. Overall, the map became more precise.</p>

In numerous experiments he found that lasting changes occurred _only_ when his monkeys paid close attention. When the animals performed tasks automatically, without paying attention, they changed their brain maps, but the changes did not last. We often praise "the ability to multitask." Well you can learn when you divide your attention, divided attention doesn't lead to abiding change in your brain maps.</p>

                <p>_Fast ForWord_ is the name of the training program they developed for language-impaired and learning-disabled children. The program exercises every basic brain function involved in language from decoding sounds up to comprehension--a kind of cerebral cross-training....</p>
                <p>The first study results, reported in the journal _Science_ in January 1996, were remarkable. Children with language impairments were divided into two groups, one that did _Fast ForWord_ and a control group that did a computer game that was similar but didn't train temporal processing or use modified speech. The two groups were matched for age, IQ, and language-processing skills. The children who did _Fast ForWord_ made significant process on standard speech, language, and auditory-processing tests, ended up with normal or better-than-normal language scores, and kept their gains when retested six weeks after training. They improved far more than children in the control group.</p>

            <title>spillover effects after brain training</title>
            <content exact="true">
                <p>Merzenich's team started hearing that _Fast ForWord_ was having a number of spillover effects. Children's handwriting improved. Parents reported that many of the students were starting to show sustained attention and focus. Merzenich thought the surprising benefits were occurring because _Fast ForWord_ led to some general improvements in mental processing.</p>
                <p>One of the most important brain activities--one we don't often think about--is the determination of how long things go on, or temporal processing. You can't move properly, proceed properly, or predict properly if you can't determine how long events last. Mezenich discovered that when you train people to distinguish very fast vibrations on their scan, lasting only 75 milliseconds, those same people could detect 75-millisecond _sounds_ as well. It seemed that _Fast ForWord_ was improving the brain's general ability to keep time. Sometimes these improvements spilled over into visual processing as well...</p>
                <p>The fact that a _visual_ component of the IQ went up meant that the IQ improvements were not caused simply because _Fast ForWord_ improved children's ability to read verbal test questions. Their mental processing was being improved in a general way, possibly because their temporal processing was improving. And there were other unexpected benefits. Some children with autism began to make some general progress....</p>
                <p>... another pilot study of one hundred autistic children showed that _Fast ForWord_ had a significant impact on their autistic symptoms as well. Their attention spans improved. Their sense of humor improved. They became more connected to people. They developed better eye contact, began greeting people and addressing them by name, spoke with them, and said good-bye at the end of their encounters. It seemed the children were beginning to experience the world as filled with other human minds.</p>

            <title>ease of learning language during the critical period</title>
            <content exact="true">
                <p>What is remarkable about the cortex in the critical period [just after birth] is that it is so plastic that its structure can be changed just by exposing it to new stimuli. That sensitivity allows babies and very young children in the critical period of language development to pick up new sounds and words effortlessly, simply by hearing their parents speak; mere exposure causes their brain maps to wire in the changes. After the critical period, older children and adults can, of course, learn languages, but they really have to _work_ to pay attention.</p>

            <title>the role of BDNF during the critical period of language development</title>
            <content exact="true">
                <p>BDNF [brain-derived neurotrophic factor] plays a crucial role in reinforcing plastic changes made in the brain in a critical period. According to Merzenich, it does this in four different ways.</p>
                <p>When we perform an activity that requires specific neurons to fire together, they release BDNF. This growth factor consolidates the connections between those neurons and helps to wire them together so they fire together reliably in the future. BDNF also promotes the growth of the thin fatty coat around each neuron that speeds up the transmission of elected signals.</p>
                <p>During the critical period BDNF turns on the nucleus basalis, the part of our brain that allows us to focus our attention--_and keeps it on, throughout the entire critical period_. Once turned on, the nucleus basalis helps us not only pay attention but remember what we are experiencing. It allows map differentiation and change to take place effortlessly. Merzenich told me, "It is like a teacher in the brain saying, 'Now _this_ is really important--this you have to know for the exam of life.'" Merzenich calls the nucleus basalis and the attention system the "regulatory control system of plasticity"--the numeral chemical system that, when turned on, puts the brain in an extremely plastic state.</p>
                <p>The fourth and final service that BDNF performs--when it has completed strengthening key connections--is to help close down the critical period. Once the main neuronal connections are laid down, there's a need for stability and hence less plasticity in system. When BDNF is released in sufficient quantities, it turns off the nucleus basalis and ends that magical epoch of effortless learning. Henceforth the nucleus can be activated only when something important, surprising, or novel occurs, or if we make the effort to pay close attention.</p>

                <p>By the time we are in our seventies, we may not have systematically engaged the systems in the brain that regulate plasticity for fifty years.</p>
                <p>That's why learning a new language in old age is so good for improving and maintaining the memory generally.

            <content exact="true">
                <p>It is reasonable to ask whether our sexual plasticity is related to neuroplasticity. Research has shown that neuroplasticity is neither ghettoized within certain departments in the brain nor confined to the sensory, motor, and cognitive processing areas we have already explored. The brain structure that regulates instinctive behaviors, including sex, called the hypothalamus, is plastic, as is the amygdala, the structure that processes emotion and anxiety. While some parts of the brain, such as the cortex, may have more plastic potential because there are more neurons and connections to be altered, even noncortical areas display plasticity. It is a property of all brain tissue. Plasticity exists in the hippocampus (the area that turns our memories from short-term too long-term ones) as well as in areas that control our breathing, process primitive sensation, and process pain. It exists in the spinal cord--as scientists have shown; actor Christopher Reeve, who suffered a severe spinal injury demonstrated such plasticity, when he was able, through relentless exercise, to recover some feeling in mobility seven years after his accident.</p>

Animals exposed to a simple tone will develop a single brain map region to process it. Animals exposed to a complex pattern, such as a melody of six tones, will not simply link together six different map regions but will develop a region that encodes the _entire_ melody. These more complex melody maps obey the same plastic principles as maps for single tones.</p>

            <title>Freud: sexual plasticity in childhood and its later consequence</title>
            <content exact="true">
                <p>One of his [Sigmund Freud's] most important contributions was his discovery of critical periods for sexual plasticity. Freud argued that an adult's ability to love intimately and sexually unfolds in stages, beginning in the infant's first passionate attachments to its parents.... Children are needy and typically develop passionate attachments to their parents. If the parent is warm, gentle, and reliable, the child will frequently develop a taste for that kind of relationship later on; if the parent is disengaged, cool, distant, self-involved, angry, ambivalent, or erratic, the child may seek out an adult mate who has similar tendencies. There are exceptions, but a significant body of research now confirms Freud's basic insight that early patterns of relating and attaching to others, if problematic, can get "wired" into our brains in childhood and repeated in adulthood.</p>

            <content exact="true">
                <p>[The author describes a scene from Tom Wolfe's novel _I Am Charlotte Simmons_ in which a male college student expresses a preference for pornography over that of a willing coed. "I've built up a tolerance to magazines...I need videos," he said. "What's the big deal?"] The big deal is his tolerance. He recognizes that he is like a drug addict who can no longer get high on the images that once turned him on. And the danger is that this tolerance will carry over into relationships, as it did in the patients whom I was seeing, leading to potency problems and new, at times unwelcome, tastes. When pornographers boast that they are pushing the envelope when introducing new, harder themes, what they don't say is that they must, because their customers are building up a tolerance to the content.</p>

            <title>how addictions causes permanent changes in the brain</title>
            <content exact="true">
                <p>Eric Nestler, at the University of Texas, has showed how addictions cause permanent changes in the brains of animals. A single dose of many addictive drugs will produce a protein, called [delta-character]FosB (pronounced "delta Fos B"), that accumulates in the neurons. Each time the drug is used, more [delta-character]FosB accumulates, until it throws a genetic switch, affecting which genes are turned on or off. Flipping the switch causes changes that persist long after the drug is stopped, leading to irreversible damage to the brain's dopamine system and rendering the animal far more prone to addiction. Nondrug addictions, such as running and sucrose drinking, also lead to the accumulation of [delta-character]FosB and the same permanent changes in the dopamine system.</p>

            <content exact="true">
                <p>The usual view is that an addict goes back for more of his fix because he likes the pleasure it gives and doesn't like the pain of withdrawal. But addicts take drugs when there is _no_ prospect of pleasure, when they know they have an insufficient dose to make them high, and will crave more even before they begin to withdraw. Wanting and liking are two different things.</p>
                <p>An addict experiences cravings because his plastic brain has become sensitized to the drug or the experience. Sensitization is different from tolerance. As tolerance develops, the addict needs more and more of a substance or porn to get a pleasant effect. As sensitization develops, he needs less and less of the substance to crave it intensely. So sensitization leads to increased wanting, though not necessarily liking. It is the accumulation of [delta-character]FosB, caused by exposure to an addictive substance or activity, that leads to sensitzation.</p>

            <title>pornography and the two kinds of pleasure</title>
            <content exact="true">
                <p>Pornography is more exciting than satisfying because we have two separate pleasure systems in our brains, one that has to do with exciting pleasure and one with satisfying pleasure. The exciting system relates to the "appetitive" pleasure that we get imagining something we desire, such as sex or a good meal. Its neurochemistry is largely dopamine-related, and it raises our tension level.</p>
                <p>The second pleasure system has to do with the satisfaction, or consummatory pleasure, that attends actually having sex or having that meal , a calming, fulfilling pleasure. Its chemistry is based on the release of endorphins, which are related to opiates and give a peaceful, euphoric bliss.</p>
                <p>Pornography, by offering an endless harem of sexual objects, hyperactivates the appetitive system. Porn viewers develop new maps in their brains, based on the photos and videos they see. Because it is a use-it-or-lose-it brain, when we develop a map area, we long to keep it activated. Just as our muscles become impatient for exercise if we've been sitting all day, so too do our senses hunger to be stimulated.</p>

            <title>how the Internet helps expand sexual addiction</title>
            <content exact="true">
                <p>The story of Sean Thomas, first published in England's _Spectator_, is a remarkable account of a man descending into a porn addiction, and it sheds light on how porn changes brain maps and alters sexual taste, as well as the role of critical-period plasticity in the process.... [Thomas describes how, as a teenager, he was not overly attracted to pornography magazines. Later in life, a curious interest in "gateway [porn] sites" led him to hard-core porn sites of increasing specificity. Thomas continues:]</p>
                <p>"My interest in spanking got me speculating: What other kinks was I harboring? What other secret and rewarding corners lurked in my sexuality that I would now be able to investigate in the privacy of my home? Plenty, as it turned out... The Net had, in other words, revealed to me that I had an unquantifiable variety of sexual fantasies and quirks and that the process of satisfying these desires online only lead to more interest...."</p>
                <p>Thomas's experience was similar to that of my patients: without being fully aware of what they were looking for, they scanned hundreds of images in scenarios until they hit upon an image or sexual script that touched some buried theme that really excited them.</p>
                <p>Once Thomas found that image, he changed. That spanking image had his _focused attention_, the condition for plastic change. And unlike a real woman, these porn images were available all day, every day on the computer. [Thomas began spending more than five hours a day surfing Internet porn, until sleep deprivation and infections landed him in an emergency room. This caused him to finally admit and question his addiction.]</p>
                <p>Clearly there was something about Thomas's sexuality, outside his awareness, that had suddenly surfaced. Does the net reveal quirks and kinks, or does it also help create them? I think it creates new fantasies out of aspects of sexuality that have been outside the surfer's conscious awareness, bringing these elements together to form new networks. It is not likely that thousands of men have witnessed, or even imagined, submissive Danish actresses intimately shaved by their dominant female partners in the shower. Freud discovered that such fantasies take hold of the mind because of the _individual_ components in them. For instance, some heterosexual men are interested in porn scenarios where older, dominant women initiate younger women into lesbian sex. This may be because boys in early childhood often feel dominated by their mothers, who are the "boss," and dress, undress, and wash them. In early childhood some boys may pass through a period when they strongly identify with their mothers and feel "like a girl," and their later interest in lesbian sex can express their residual unconscious female identification. Hard-core porn unmasks some of the early neural networks that formed in the critical periods of sexual development and brings all these early, forgotten, or repressed elements together to form a new network, in which all the features are wired together.</p>
                <p>Porn sites generate catalogs of common kinks and mix them together in images. Sooner or later the surfer finds a killer combination that presses a number of his sexual buttons at once. Then he reinforces the network by viewing the images repeatedly, masturbating, releasing dopamine and strengthening these networks. He has created a kind of "neosexuality," a rebuilt libido that has strong roots in his buried sexual tendencies. Because he often develops tolerance, the pleasure of sexual discharge must be supplemented with the pleasure of an aggressive release, and sexual and aggressive images are increasingly mingled--hence the increase in sadomasochistic themes in hard-core porn.</p>

            <title>how falling in love affects perception</title>
            <content exact="true">
                <p>When a person gets high on cocaine, becomes manic, or falls in love, he enters an enthusiastic state and is optimistic about everything, because all three conditions lower the firing threshold for the _appetitive_ pleasure system, the dopamine-based system associated with the pleasure of anticipating something we desire. The addict, the manic, and the lover are increasingly filled with hopeful anticipation and are sensitive to anything that might give pleasure--flowers and fresh air inspire them, and a slight but thoughtful gesture makes them delight in all mankind. I call this process "globalization."</p>
                <p>Globalization is intense when falling in love and is, I believe, one of the main reasons that romantic love is such a powerful catalyst for plastic change. Because the pleasure centers are firing so freely, the enamored person falls in love not only with the beloved but with the world and romanticizes his view of it. Because our brains are experiencing a surge of dopamine, which consolidates plastic change, any pleasurable experiences and associations we have in the initial state of love are thus wired into our brains.</p>

                <p>Globalization not only allows us to take more pleasure in the world, it also makes it harder for us to experience pain and displeasure or aversion. [Robert] Heath showed that when our pleasure centers fire, it is more difficult for the nearby pain and aversion centers to fire too. Things that normally bother us don't. We love being in love not only because it makes it easy for us to be happy but also because it makes it harder for us to be unhappy.</p>

            <content exact="true">
                <p>Globalization also creates an opportunity for us to develop new tastes in what we find attractive, like the pockmark [on his lover's face] that gave Alberic such pleasure. Neurons that fire together wire together, and feeling pleasure in the presence of this normally unappealing pockmark causes it to get wired into the brain as a source of delight. A similar mechanism occurs when a "reformed" cocaine addict passes the seedy alleyway where he first took the drug and is overwhelmed with cravings so powerful that he goes back to it.</p>

                <p>But the pains of love also have a chemistry. When separated too long, lovers crash and experience withdrawal, crave their beloved, get anxious, doubt themselves, lose their energy, and feel run-down if not depressed.... These "addictive symptoms"--the highs, crashes, cravings, withdrawal, and fixes--are subjective signs of plastic changes occurring in the structure of our brains, as they adapt to the presence or absence of the beloved.</p>
